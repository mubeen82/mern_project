    <p><em>Imagine</em> playing a first-person shooter game. If Player A lags 75
        milliseconds behind Player B, they might shoot in a location where
        they believe Player B to be, but that Player B and the game’s server
        know Player B has already left.</p><hr>
        
        <p>This <strong>discrepancy</strong> means the virtual
        world’s server must decide whose experiences are “true” (that is,
        which should be rendered and persist across all participants) and
        whose experiences must be rejected.</p>
        
        <p>In most cases the experience
        of the participant who lagged will be rejected so that the other
        participants can proceed. The Metaverse can’t really function as a
        parallel plane for human existence if many of those within it
        experience conflicting (and then invalidated) versions of it.</p>
